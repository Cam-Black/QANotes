Sprints
-------
A sprint is *ANY* length of time in which work is done *e.g:* A month long project might take 4 week-long sprints to complete.

- Tasks are assigned to a 'sprint backlog' during a sprint,
- Tasks are cleare from the backlog as they are completed,
- All tasks for a project are added to a 'project backlog' and is where we populate the 'sprint backlog' from:
    - Product backlog contains *ALL* tasks needed to complete a project,
    - A Product owner is assigned and responsible for maintaining the product backlog,
    - Each task will have a description, a time weighting, a priority

For Sprint Backlogs:
- All items are selected from product backlog,
- These tasks should be completed by the end of the sprint,
- Use KANBAN style when managing tasks, (to do, in progress, done)

**Meetings**

There are 4 main kinds:
- Sprint planning meeting
- Daily Standup

- Sprint retro
