Intro to Scrum

**What is it?**<br>

Scrum gets its name from Rugby:
- Quick

Sprints
-------
A sprint is *ANY* length of time in which work is done *e.g:* A month long project might take 4 week-long sprints to complete.

- Tasks are assigned to a 'sprint backlog' during a sprint,
- Tasks are cleare from the backlog as they are completed,
- All tasks for a project are added to a 'project backlog' and is where we populate the 'sprint backlog' from:
    - Product backlog contains *ALL* tasks needed to complete a project,
    - A Product owner is assigned and responsible for maintaining the product backlog,
    - Each task will have a description, a time weighting, a priority

For Sprint Backlogs:
- All items are selected from product backlog,
- These tasks should be completed by the end of the sprint,
- Use KANBAN style when managing tasks, (to do, in progress, done)

**Meetings**
------------
There are 4 main kinds:
- Sprint planning meeting
- Daily Standup
- Sprint review meeting
- Sprint retro

**Product Backlog**
-------------------
Many differen kind of items you can add to a product backlog:
- User Story
- Use Cases
- Bugs, Fixes, Errors,
- Constraints,
- Tasks

**User Stories**
--------------
A user story is expected behaviour of a product from the user perspective:
- Break down functionality based on requirements.
- User Keywords:
    - As a,
    - I want,
    - So that,
    - Given,
    - When,
    - and then
